# ALSTAR First Event Autogrouper

:globe_with_meridians: Website: https://mastarcheeze.github.io/autogrouper

## Synopsis

This program automatically assigns people into groups based on preference. Participants select their first, second and
third choices of groups they want to be in, and the program automatically assigns each person a group on a first come
first serve basis. The choice selection is done through Google Forms and the data is input as a CSV file.

Made to quicken the process of grouping for the ALSTAR First Event during the ALSTAR First Meeting.
